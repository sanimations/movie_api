    My API, movie_api, will be used to create an application
    to filter between many different LGBTQ+ movies.  I am keeping 
    the name as movie_api because this will be just the API for
    the full application that will be titled "PrideFlix".  This
    API will separate each film into different categories that have
    not been determined just yet.
