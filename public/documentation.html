    My API, movie_api, will be used to create an application
    to filter between many different LGBTQ+ movies.  The full
    application will have the name "queer films" for now.  
    In this API you area allowed to search by title and director.
    I will, hopefully soon, introduce a way to filter by genre
    as well.  Updates will soon introduce a system to actually
    keep username and passwords on the site and keep them safe.
    Most of these endpoints need authorization, which you can get
    by creating an account and logging in.  This list is comprised
    of all the endpoints besides /documentation.html and '/'.
